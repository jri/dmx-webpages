# DeepaMehta 4 Webpages

This DeepaMehta 4 Plugin brings simple, _multi-site_ web-publishing capabilities to your DeepaMehta 4 installation. 

Installing it introduces the types _Website_, _Webpage_, _Webpage Section_, _Tile_, _Button_, _Link_,  _Redirect_, _Menu Item_ to your DeepaMehta 4.

![Website Example: Setup of the Kiezatlas Webpages](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-webpages/raw/master/kiezatlas-website-setup-graph-only.png)

Feature-wise it allows for a global standard website and a website for each user. Each website can appear in a different style or layout, has its own topics and namespace. Webpages can be extended with Headers, Sections, Tiles, Buttons using various predefined layouts. Users are also allowed to edit JavaScript as part of their page and integrate images in a responsive manner on pages.

Furthermore, the HTML generated by this module tries to map (at best as possible) the DeepaMehta standard types to terms of the [Schema.org](https://schema.org) vocabulary.

It builds on our recent work, especially on the [dm4-thymeleaf](https://github.com/jri/dm4-thymeleaf) module.

## Installation Requirements

See [system requirements at jri/deepamehta](https://github.com/jri/deepamehta/#1-check-requirements)

It is recommended to use DeepaMehta 4.8.6 (or higher) and it is required to use the following

 * [dm4-thymeleaf-0.6.1](https://github.com/jri/dm4-thymeleaf) module

You'll find both available for download both at [http://download.deepamehta.de](http://download.deepamehta.de).

## Usage: Creating a Webpage

To start working a _Webpage_ simply use the `Create` menu in Toolbar (upper grey area of DeepaMehta).

To publish a _Webpage_ it must be connected to a _Website_.

1. Navigate and reveal your **Website** (e.g. via following the `My Website` button after clicking your `Username` in the `Toolbar`). The website topic allows you to edit and enter some basic information which occurs on all your webpages (Footer, About, Layout, etc):

You can also reveal your website through search `By Type` and then selecting `Website`.

2. Creating a _Webpage_ is as simple as using the `New Webpage` when having selected a `Website` item.

That's it. Your webpage is now published under your hostname and its so called _Web Alias_. The very same steps apply if you want to publish a _Redirect_ or a  _Menu item_ on your website.

Note: The permission who can see your published webpage depends on the so called _SharingMode_ of the workspace your webpage is assigned to.
