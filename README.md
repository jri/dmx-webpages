# DMX Webpages

This DMX plugin brings simple, _multi-site_ web-publishing capabilities to your DMX 4 installation. 

Installing it introduces the types _Website_, _Webpage_, _Webpage Section_, _Tile_, _Button_, _Link_,  _Redirect_, _Menu Item_ to your DMX installation.

![Website Example: Setup of the Kiezatlas Webpages](https://github.com/mukil/dm4-webpages/raw/master/kiezatlas-website-setup-graph-only.png)

Feature-wise, this plugins allows for one global website ("Standard Website") as well as a website for each DMX user. Each website can appear in a different style or layout, has its own namespace and its own topics. Webpages can be extended with _Headers, Sections, Tiles, Buttons_ using various predefined layouts (_Section Layout_). Users are also allowed to include custom JavaScript or CSS into their page as well as integrating image-files in a responsive manner on their pages.

Furthermore, the HTML generated by this module tries to map (at best as possible) the DMX standard types to the terms of the [Schema.org](https://schema.org) vocabulary.

Webpages is build on the [dmx-thymeleaf](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-thymeleaf) module.

## Installation Requirements

See [system requirements at jri/deepamehta](https://github.com/jri/DMX/#1-check-requirements)

It is recommended to use DMX 5.0-beta-7 (or higher) and it is required to use the following

 * [dmx-thymeleaf-0.9.1](https://download.dmx.systems/plugins/dmx-thymeleaf/) module

You'll find both available for download both at [https://download.dmx.systems](https://download.dmx.systems).

## Usage: Creating a Webpage

To start working a _Webpage_ simply use the `Create` menu in the "Search/Create" dialog of DMX Webclient.

To publish a _Webpage_ it must be connected to a _Website_.

1. Search and reveal your **Website**. The website topic allows you to edit and enter some basic information which occurs on all connected webpages (Footer, About, Layout, etc):

You can also reveal your website through search `By Type` and then selecting `Website`.

2. Creating a _Webpage_ is as simple as using the `New Webpage` when having selected your `Website` topic.

That's it. Your webpage is now published under your hostname and its so called _Web Alias_. The very same steps apply if you want to publish a _Redirect_ or a  _Menu item_ on your website.

Note: The permission who can see your published webpage depends on the so called _SharingMode_ of the workspace your webpage is assigned to. You can learn more about sharing data with the public or within a group of users in the [DMX User Guide](https://docs.dmx.systems).
